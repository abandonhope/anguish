    content : After FISH, I was running out of ways to bore my colleagues. With Anguish, I can bang on all day about how much better it is than zsh and FISH. Everyone is so impressed. I think Zelda in Marketing might nosh me as a result.

    content : "As an artisan, I need the finest, most well designed tools to help me produce beautiful code. That's why I choose Anguish: it's almost unheard of at the moment and so I sound like a true pioneer when I scold other developers for not using it. I may even get a hand-shandy off of Quentin in customer service as a result."
